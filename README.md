### **Intro**
  
This project was designed as an aid for my coworkers to be able to count the money in the back of house with ease.
  
### **Overview**
  
Vault Counter features 3 different sections, color coded for viewing convience. Each individual card number inputs that trigger JavaScript
functionality to live update the server with the rolling total of individual denominations and the cumulative total of all cash on hand. This
makes the data extremely easy to transfer into the required company spreadsheet data, without requiring on the fly math.

- Green - Coin
  * Pennies - $.50 a roll or $25 a box
  * Nickels - $2 a roll or $100 a box
  * Dimes - $5 a roll or $250 a box
  * Quarters - $10 a roll or $500 a box
- Blue - Small Bills
  * Ones - $100 per bundle
  * Fives - $500 per bundle
  * Tens - $10 per bundle
- Red - Large Bills

### **Future Plans**

- Clean up the JavaScript so it is no longer quite as repetetive for the inner functions
- Create a data storage ability for users to be able to locally store their count
- Add a clear button to empty all values simultaneously
- Add color themes for users
